In Ruby,  instance variable cannot be referenced externally
=> create method to refer to them

Ruby can do inheritance

All that matters is when you invoke objects on a method that method should exist (class does not matter)

Module: collection of methods
Use it by add it into a class (similar to multiple inheritance)
The most used module - Enumerable : has to have a “each” method and comparison method (map method can be used without comparison)

Metaprogramming
     Reflection: metalanguage is also the programming language
     Define "method missing"
