Intro to Relational Database
     Tables/ Relations
          rows/tuples/record
          columns/attribute  [ type: VARCHAR(SIZE)/DATE/FLOAT/INT  (one thing in each column) ]
          primary key - unique identifier
     Schema - structure
          name of the table, names/ types of attributes, constraints (tuples are not part of schema)
     SQL - Structured Query Language
          standardized (partially)
          uses mySQL in this class
          no name convention

Query name &extract info
     - specify “what”: name by contents
     - DB decides how
     - SELECT(attribute)/ FROM(table(s))/ WHERE(cond)/ ORDER BY(attributes) (DESC, ASC - default)
     - UPDATE(table)/ SET(value)/ WHERE (cond)

Joins: relationships between tables
     many-to-one: select data from one table while taking data in other tables as condition
     many-to-many: select data from multiple tables while taking data in multiple tables as condition)

Other important features
     Indexes: additional date structure to speed up searching
     Transactions: guarantee atomicity of (multiple) actions

Pros and cons of DB
Pros:
     data model
     built-in features
     transaction
Cons:
     semantic gap
     scalability( differences between DB system, make it hard for global usage)
